# Learning C++

This is a personal repository for the purpose of showing and maintaining my education of the C++ language.

I have started by working on a Matrix container class, which demonstrates knowledge and application of key C++ OOP concepts, as well as basic matrix algebra.

This repository will eventually contain code related to algorithms and data structures as I learn them.
